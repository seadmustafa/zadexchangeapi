## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Overview

A robust, scalable API for managing user balances in USD and TRY currencies:

‚úÖ Users can **deposit**, **withdraw**, **retrieve balance**, and **exchange currencies** between accounts in **TRY** and **USD**.

‚úÖ Exchange rates retrieved from [https://www.exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com), valid for 1 minute  

‚úÖ Withdraw and Deposit operations are **asynchronous** with status tracking.  

‚úÖ Built with clean code principles, high test coverage, and Docker support.

‚úÖ Rate limiter has been implemented to prevent abuse and enhancing system protection and stability.

## üî• Additional Features for Demonstration & Observability



- **Mock Users and Accounts:**  
  The application automatically generates demo users and initializes USD/TRY accounts with predefined balances on startup, simplifying local testing and demo scenarios.

- **Kafka UI Integration:**  
  A Kafka UI is bundled with the Docker setup, providing full visibility into Kafka topics, partitions, and message streams. Access to Kafka UI enables real-time tracking of all asynchronous operations for debugging and observability.

- **Scalability Demonstration via Load Generator:**  
  A scheduled cron job executes every **2 minutes**, sending 500 concurrent requests to simulate production-like load. This demonstrates application scalability, responsiveness under load, and ensures API availability during continuous operation.

## Testing 

-------
 
The project achieves an overall test coverage of **89% per line**.

- Core services, Kafka integration, Redis logic, and API endpoints are well covered.
- Critical scenarios such as valid transactions, invalid inputs, and error handling are tested.
- Some non-critical areas, like logging statements, auto-generated IDs, and occasional exception branches, remain partially uncovered.

In general, the codebase maintains strong, reliable test coverage, suitable for production environments.
